When I took coding classes in 2012, I was taught to create website layouts using divs, with external CSS stylesheets. So when I landed my first job, you can imagine how confused I was when the site was built entirely with tables. I felt like I had to learn a new language. Then I realized, my boss, ten years my senior, had yet to learn to responsive code. 

I love web development. Its always improving and being adjusted for the period of time. And there is always something new to learn. I could only hope other pieces of our lives could catch up.
